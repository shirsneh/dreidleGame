- Dynamic player movements and interactions.
- Reset functionality to play multiple rounds.

## How It Works

### Game Logic
1. **Board Setup**:
   - The board is a 5x5 grid with tiles randomly assigned one of four colors: red, blue, green, yellow.
   - Players start at opposite sides of the board:
     - Player 1 begins at `[0, 2]` and aims to reach row 4.
     - Player 2 begins at `[4, 2]` and aims to reach row 0.

2. **Player Movement**:
   - Players spin the dreidel, which randomly selects a color.
   - Based on the spin result, the current player moves to an adjacent tile of the same color.
   - If no valid move exists, the turn passes to the other player.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - A player wins by reaching their respective goal row.

### Frontend and 3D Rendering
- **Three.js** is used for rendering the 3D board and player tokens.
- The board tiles are represented as colored cubes.
- Players are represented as 3D spheres that move dynamically across the board.
